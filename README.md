# Description
There are several netcdf files in `data/`.  Each file contains time-series of several environmental variables.  Use `main.py` to time-average some of these variables and save to output file in `avg_data/`. Time averages are averaged across files.

# Requirements

- For testing `pytest`

# Usage
